# PowerUpâš¡

Flutter project making top up in game currency.

## Overview

"PowerUp" is a Flutter-based application that my team and I are developing as part of our Project-Based Learning (PJBL) assignment at school. It is designed to streamline the process of topping up in-game currency. "PowerUp" provides a seamless, user-friendly interface that makes the process of purchasing in-game currency quick, effortless, and safety.

The application is currently in the front-end development stage. The application is designed to be cross-platform (Coming Soon).

In the upcoming phase, "PowerUp" will integrate with Firebase for back-end services.
